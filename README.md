## reason of  writing this code
Because I am learning Pytorch at present,this is a link of course[Pytorch](https://youtu.be/V_xro1bcAuA?si=b0_8yWiFXzLcFdnr).When I start the training loop, finding that the too many loops will waste possibly.For example,when I set the "epoch = 10000",but maybe it can achieve good fitting effect in 100times,and remaining times will consume mermory.**So, I want to design the programming to stop the loop previously.**(notice: I write the code with deepseekR1)
